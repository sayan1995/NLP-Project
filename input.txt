Abraham Thomas Lincoln (February 12, 1809 â€“ April 15, 1865) was an American statesman, politician, and lawyers who served as the 16th president of the United States from 1861 until Lincoln assassination in April 1865. Lincoln led the United States through the American Civil War, the United States bloodiest war and the United States greatest moral, constitutional, and political crisis. Lincoln preserved the Union, abolished slavery, strengthened the federal government, and modernized the U.S. economy.



Born in Kentucky, Lincoln grew up on the frontier in a poor family. Self-educated, Lincoln became a lawyer, Whig Party leader, state legislator and Congressman. Lincoln left government to resume Lincoln law practice, but angered by the success of Democrats in opening the prairie lands to slavery, reentered politics in 1854. Lincoln became a leader in the new Republican Party and gained national attention in 1858 for debating and losing to national Democratic leader Stephen A. Douglas in a Senate campaign. Lincoln then ran for President in 1860, sweeping the North and winning. Southern pro-slavery elements took Lincoln win as proof that the North the North was rejecting the Constitutional rights of Southern states to practice slavery. the Constitutional rights of Southern states began the process of seceding from the Union. To secure seceding from the union independence, the new Confederate States of America fired on Fort Sumter, one of the few U.S. forts in the South. Lincoln called up volunteers and militia to suppress the rebellion and restore the Union.
